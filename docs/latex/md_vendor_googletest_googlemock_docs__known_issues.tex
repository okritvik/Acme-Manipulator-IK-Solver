As any non-\/trivial software system, Google \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mock}{Mock}} has some known limitations and problems. We are working on improving it, and welcome your help! The follow is a list of issues we know about.\hypertarget{md_vendor_googletest_googlemock_docs__known_issues_autotoc_md188}{}\doxysubsection{R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E contains outdated information on Google Mock\textquotesingle{}s compatibility with other testing frameworks}\label{md_vendor_googletest_googlemock_docs__known_issues_autotoc_md188}
The {\ttfamily R\+E\+A\+D\+ME} file in release 1.\+1.\+0 still says that Google \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mock}{Mock}} only works with Google Test. Actually, you can configure Google \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mock}{Mock}} to work with any testing framework you choose.\hypertarget{md_vendor_googletest_googlemock_docs__known_issues_autotoc_md189}{}\doxysubsection{Tests failing on machines using Power P\+C C\+P\+Us (e.\+g. some Macs)}\label{md_vendor_googletest_googlemock_docs__known_issues_autotoc_md189}
{\ttfamily gmock\+\_\+output\+\_\+test} and {\ttfamily gmock-\/printers\+\_\+test} are known to fail with Power PC C\+P\+Us. This is due to portability issues with these tests, and is not an indication of problems in Google \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mock}{Mock}} itself. You can safely ignore them.\hypertarget{md_vendor_googletest_googlemock_docs__known_issues_autotoc_md190}{}\doxysubsection{Failed to resolve libgtest.\+so.\+0 in tests when built against installed Google Test}\label{md_vendor_googletest_googlemock_docs__known_issues_autotoc_md190}
This only applies if you manually built and installed Google Test, and then built a Google \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mock}{Mock}} against it (either explicitly, or because gtest-\/config was in your path post-\/install). In this situation, Libtool has a known issue with certain systems\textquotesingle{} ldconfig setup\+:

\href{http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.automake.general/9025}{\texttt{ http\+://article.\+gmane.\+org/gmane.\+comp.\+sysutils.\+automake.\+general/9025}}

This requires a manual run of \char`\"{}sudo ldconfig\char`\"{} after the \char`\"{}sudo make install\char`\"{} for Google Test before any binaries which link against it can be executed. This isn\textquotesingle{}t a bug in our install, but we should at least have documented it or hacked a work-\/around into our install. We should have one of these solutions in our next release.
