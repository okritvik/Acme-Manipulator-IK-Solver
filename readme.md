</p>

In order to augment the robotic solution capabilities of Acme Robotics Inc., a manipulator inverse kinematics based path planner software project is proposed to be deployed on the 7 DOF KUKA WIIA industrial robot in an automobile manufacturing plant's assembly-line. The proposed software solution shall consist of a Jacobian based Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver to generate a smooth trajectory for the end-effector of the robot to be able to transport various automobile components between different stations in the assembly-line. The generated joint angular velocity profiles from the desired end-effector cartesian velocities (obtained from the position trajectory) are then numerically integrated to obtain the joint angles required to achieve such a configuration. Such a velocity-based approach to computing the inverse kinematics of the robot, in lieu of the traditional position-based approach, ensures a smooth joint velocity profile in addition to achieving the desired trajectory, which is of importance in a large scale assembly-unit involving heavy payloads and human workers. The usage of an existing industrial maniuplator like the KUKA provides the company with easy access to scheduled maintenance and repairs of the robotic setup.    

The software design and development process shall involve adhering to an amalgamation of Agile Iterative Processes and pair-programming techniques over a course of two weeks. The efficacy of the implementation shall be verified using the test-driven development approach. The driver and navigator roles are exchanged during each phase of the project to effectively develop and complete the backlogs.

## Purpose & Methodology
The main aim of this project is to implement the complete API for the robot manipulator arm to enable it to perform tasks similar to 'pick and place' in an automobile industry setting such that it can be directly placed in the corresponding zone in the assembly line and ready to be used. The approach taken to develop this API also enables in modularity of usage of this robot wherein the robot arm can be mounted in a new zone and with minor changes can immediately adapt to the new task. Also, more sensor and end-effector tools can be added to augment its capabilities in the assembly-line. This is because a car manufacturing assembly line typically contains multiple use cases for robot manipulators such as, transporting payloads, spray-painting the assembled vehicles, visual inspection of the automobile surface for defects, and so on, all under one room. Hence, this project was proposed to Acme Robotics Inc. as an opportunity to leverage their expertise in a fast-growing and in-demand sector.

As previously mentioned, the KUKA robot was chosen as the robot for which such an API is to be developed, due to the extensive use of such robots in the automobile manufacturing industry (for example: MINI Cooper). The major components in the Robot's API are the Kinematics Solver, Controller and Simulator. Additional components may be integrated if the requirement arises. The Kinematics Solver module is responsible for performing the forward and inverse kinematics of the robot, for both position and velocities, to generate a trajectory for the robot end-effector, using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention and the Jacobian of the robot. In reality, the path/solution generated by the Kinematics module is never accurate due to mechanical wear and tear of robot joints, expansion/contraction of robot links due to change in temperature conditions and inaccuracies in the kinematic parameters of the robot. Hence, the Controller module defines a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) based control strategy to ensure the robot follows the desired trajectory to reach the final position within an error threshold. Before the deployment of the above on the actual robot, it is important to verify on a simulated robot so as to prevent workspace singularities. Hence, the Simulator module enables the visualization of the robot and it's kinematic solutions. 

Thus, the following personnel shall implement the above using pair-programming where one of them serves as the driver while the other as the navigator and switching roles after each iteration, with appropriately defined test cases to validate the solution at each stage in the iterative process, which shall last about two weeks in total.

## Developer Documentation
### Environment Setup
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/okritvik/Acme-Manipulator-IK-Solver/tree/Phase1.git
```

### Dependencies
1. [NumCpp](https://dpilger26.github.io/NumCpp/doxygen/html/index.html): This is used to make use of NumPy functionalities such as the creation of matrices and their associated operations in C++.
```
cd Acme-Manipulator-IK-Solver/NumCpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install .
```
2. [Matplot++](https://alandefreitas.github.io/matplotplusplus/): This is used to leverage MATLAB styled plotting functions in C++, to visualize the Robot. </br>
This dependency is already included with the project's `CMakeLists.txt` file, and hence requires no additional installation/build.

3. [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info): This is a graphic utility used by Matplotplusplus as a plotting engine. To install this dependency, run:
```
sudo apt-get install gnuplot
```
### Build
In the project's top level directory `/Acme-Manipulator-IK-Solver`, run the following:
```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Build for Code Coverage
Change to the project's `/build` directory using the `cd build` command.
```
sudo apt-get install lcov
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make 
make code_coverage
```

### Run Demo
To run the demo, change to the `/build` directory as done previously: 
```
./app/acme-demo
```

### Run Tests
To run the Google Test cases: 
```
./test/acme-test
```

### Doxygen Docs
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) is used to generate HTML and LaTEX documentation for the project's API. To install and run Doxygen:

```sudo apt update
sudo apt install doxywizard
sudo apt install doxygen-gui
sudo apt install graphviz

// To run the GUI and generate documentation
dozywizard
```
To display the documentation in a Web Browser (like firefox):
```
firefox ./docs/html/index.html
```

The documentation is saved in the ```/docs``` directory. 


### cppcheck
Change to the root directory of the project, and run:
```
cppcheck --enable=all --std=c++17 ./app/*.cpp ./include/*.hpp ./test/*.cpp --suppress=missingIncludeSystem --suppress=unmatchedSuppression --suppress=unusedFunction --suppress=missingInclude --suppress=useInitializationList > results/cppcheck.txt
```
The results of running ```cppcheck``` can be found in ```/results/cppcheck.txt```.

### cpplint
Change to the root directory of the project, and run:
```
cpplint ./app/*.cpp ./include/*.hpp ./test/*.cpp &> ./results/cpplint.txt
```
The results of running ```cpplint``` can be found in ```/results/cpplint.txt```.

### Valgrind
Change to the root directory of the project, and run:
```
sudo apt install valgrind
cd build
valgrind --leak-check=full -v ./app/acme-demo >& ../results/valgrind_result.txt
```
### KCachegrind
Change to the root directory of the project, and run:
```
sudo apt-get install -y kcachegrind
cd build
valgrind --tool=callgrind ./app/acme-demo
kcachegrind
```
If `kcachegrind` doesn't open the required file, open the file `callgrind.out.xxxx` file in the GUI.

## Known Issues/Bugs
1. Installation of NumCpp from the author might run into [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) requirement errors. To address this, change `option(NUMCPP_NO_USE_BOOST "Don't use the boost libraries" OFF)` to `option(NUMCPP_NO_USE_BOOST "Don't use the boost libraries" ON)`in the `CMakeLists.txt` of the NumCpp directory.
2. `make` command may produce some errors from the matplotplusplus dependencies. This can be rectified by properly linking all the executables with matplotplusplus and installing gnuplot.
3. While executing the software, the terminal may show warnings corresponding to the limits of simulation figure axes. These can be ignored.
